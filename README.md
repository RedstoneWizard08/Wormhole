## History

Wormhole was originally known as the SpaceWarp Installer, and then @Rexicon226 and
@RedstoneWizard08 decided to expand it out into a fully fledged game launcher and
mod manager for KSP 1 and KSP 2. After about 6 months, @RedstoneWizard08 then decided
to expand it out into a general mod manager and game launcher to support many other
games (which can be suggested via issues).
