# mcmeta

This isn't just metadata. This is a modloader installer.
This supports Vanilla, Fabric, Forge, Quilt, and NeoForge.

## Some "Notes"

- Forge & NeoForge's installer processes are an absolute clusterf**k.
- I have spent a week on this, and I don't want to deal with it anymore.
- Quilt, I love you, you're simple.
- Why does Fabric still use LaunchWrapper?
- WHY DOES FORGE. NEED TO. PATCH THE CLIENT JAR. WHY???
