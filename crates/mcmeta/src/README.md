# Important Note!

There is a LOT of code here that was initially created to try to
re-create part of Minecraft Forge's installer. I am no longer going
to be using this code.

Why am I including it here then? Because I spent the better part of
a week making it and I didn't feel like throwing it all away. I'll
include it here because it may be useful to others (especially the
TSRG v2 parsing part) and because I spent so much time on it.

In the future, I may come back to this, but for now I'll just be using
the base Forge installer JAR's processors, run through whatever Java
executable is present.
